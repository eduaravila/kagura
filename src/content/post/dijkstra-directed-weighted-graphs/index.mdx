## Dijkstra

> we need to get the path from vector a to vector b that ends up summing up the minimum from it's edges

**only for weighted directed graphs with positive weights**

with adjacency list we need
`visited []bool
weights []*Edge
path []*Edge`

- start all the weights to be infinite, `&Edge{vector: vector, weight: Inf}`
- first we set the weight of the "a" vector to be 0 because we know that we need 0 steps to get from a to a
- then we need to get the min weight from the weights arr, in the first step we'll get the "a" vector because it's the only one with 0 and all of the others are inf we call this **u**
	- here we mark the resulting vector as `visited[vector] = true``, this is to be sure we don't get in an infinite loop
- we iterate until **u** != nil
	- add **u** to the path `path = append(path, u)
	- `v := u.edges.front()` will be equal to the first edge in u
		- iterate until `v != nil``
			- try to **relax** the edges and weights, this means, compare the u + edge weights with v weight, or   `if weights[v] > weights[u]+ edge.weight` then update `weights[v]= weights[u]+ edge.weight`, this will help us in the next iteration
	- again we get the next min, in this case will be different because we updated the weights of the edges from **u**

	newWeight := (*weights)[u.index].weight + v.weight

		(*weights)[v.vector.index].weight = newWeight
		v.weight = newWeight
	}

	weights[a.index].weight = 0
	u := G.extractMinimumWeight(&visited, &weights)

			path = append(path, u)
			break
		}
		v := u.vector.edges.FrontNode()
		path = append(path, u)
