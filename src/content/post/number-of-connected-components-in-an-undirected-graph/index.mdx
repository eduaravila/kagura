> Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:
     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.

<Picture src={example1} widths={[200, 400, 800]} sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" alt="A rocket blasting off." />



Example 2:
     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.

<Picture src={example2} widths={[200, 400, 800]} sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" alt="A rocket blasting off." />

Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

# approach union find
- check if the "left" vector has parent if not make it itself
- the second vector parent will be left
  - the compress part makes sure all the "children" vectors point to the root node and can get it in constant time
  - also the diffent number of groups is equal to the response

		res[val] = true
