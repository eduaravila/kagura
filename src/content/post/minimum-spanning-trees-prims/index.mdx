## minimumSpanningTrees (prims)
```go
  visited []bool
  weights []heap
  path []*Edge
```

> the goal is to get a path with all of the edges / vectors that have the minimum weights, for example you can compare the weights with "money" we this algorithm could help us build the cheapest road (edges) that connects all of the vectors

- we need to initialize the data structures
	- visited all start as false
	- weights are all of the edges so we need the complete edge, \{from: vector, to: vector.edges.front(), weight: inf\}, we mark the weights to be equal to inf
	- path will start with nil pointer
	- after that we choose the starting vector and update
		- visited[s] = true
		- weights[s] = 0
