there are multiple ways to create a real-time chat, where user A can communicate with user B and user C.
On this occasion, we'll create a server chat where multiple users can enter a user name and send/receive messages in real-time.

For this article you will need to have previous experience with:

- channels
- goroutines

let's get started!

first, we need a way to accept incoming connections.

## accept connections

```go
package huevosrevueltos.com/simplechat

func buildServer() {
	server, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080") // localhost:8080

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("could not start chat: %v", err)
	}

	for {
		conn, err := server.Accept()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal("connection err: %v", err)
			continue
		}
		go handleConnection(conn) // start new goroutine per connection
	}
}

```

> with this function we start listening for connections in port 8080.
> In an infinite loop, we keep accepting new connections until the program stops.

## client

```go
func handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(conn)

	for scanner.Scan(){
		if scanner.Err() != nil{
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(scanner.Text())
	}

	defer conn.Close()

}
```

> this simple connection handler will print a message every time a client writes to its console

## give it structure

the next step it's to give more structure to the chat and start sending and start processing the messages.

### chat

the chat struct will be in charge of receiving, sending, and booking rooms for clients

```go
type chat struct {
	clients      []*client
	messageQueue chan []byte
}
```

> message queue is a channel that waits for incoming client messages, and then propagates them

### client

client holds more logic, so let's go by steps

```go
type client struct {
	name  string
	conn  net.Conn
	in    chan []byte
	out   chan []byte
	token chan struct{}
}
```

- **name**: is the username of the client, after the connection is established the server asks the user to put a user name to
- **conn**: is the connection we start with the server
- **in**: incoming messages channel
- **out**: outgoing messages channel
- **token**: room token that it's held until the connection is finished

## listen for connections

```go
func (c *chat) buildServer() {
	server, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080") // localhost:8080

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("could not start chat: %v", err)
	}
	go c.serve()
	for {
		conn, err := server.Accept()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("connection err: %v", err)
			continue
		}
		go c.handleConnection(conn) // start new goroutine per connection
	}
}

```

the structure here didn't change that much, `go c.serve` creates a new goroutine that will handle the message queue and send the message to all the connected clients.

## start the new client and book a new room

next, we need to create a new client and the channels where she can send/receive messages

```go
func (c *chat) handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
	in, out := make(chan []byte), make(chan []byte)
	client := newClient(conn, in, out)
	c.clients = append(c.clients, client)
	client.start()
	go c.bookRoom(client)
	<-client.token
	defer conn.Close()
}

```

the steps that this function follows are

- start the user
- add the client to the current chat
- create a new "room" to listen for messages from the client

## setting up user

```go

func newClient(conn net.Conn, in chan []byte, out chan []byte) *client {
	return &client{in: in, out: out, conn: conn}
}

```

here we ask the user for a `username` and start goroutines for incoming and outgoing messages

```go
func (cl *client) start() {
	cl.setUpUsername()
	go cl.receiveMessages()
	go cl.sendMessages()
}
```

## receive messages

here we create a new scanner and go until the connection ends or an error happens

```go
func (cl *client) receiveMessages() {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(cl.conn)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		if scanner.Err() != nil {
			log.Fatalf("receive messages %v: ", scanner.Err())
			break
		}
		cl.in <- scanner.Bytes()
	}
	cl.token <- struct{}{} // end connection
}

```

> the content of the scanners is redirected to the in-client channel and then it's added to the chat message queue

## send messages

to send messages to a specific client, we listen to the out channel and write to the connection

```go
func (cl *client) sendMessages() {
	for msg := range cl.out {

		cl.conn.Write(msg)
	}
}
```

## test #1

let's give it a go and run the server and a couple of clients
**server**

```
go run main. go
```

this will start listening to connections on port 8080

**for the clients we'll use [nc](https://ss64.com/osx/nc.html)**

**client A**

```
nc localhost 8080
Enter your username: megumin
welcome megumin

```

**client B**

```
nc localhost 8080
Enter your username: gopher
welcome gopher
```

if we write a message on either client we should see the message in both places

**client A**

```
nc localhost 8080
Enter your username: megumin
welcome megumin
gopher says: hello megumin
```

**client B**

```
 nc localhost 8080
Enter your username: gopher
welcome gopher
hello megumin
gopher says: hello megumin
```

Cool, we have a working chat in place, the next and final step for this time it's to let the other users know when someone leaves the chat

## exit queue channel

this will help us close the channels, and the connection and let the other users in the room who left the chat

```go
type chat struct {
	clients      map[*client]bool //<- notice the update to clients
	messageQueue chan []byte
	exitQueue    chan *client
}
```

the exit queue is a channel that holds clients

## exit guide

```go
func (c *chat) exitGuide(client *client) {
	delete(c.clients, client)
	close(client.in)
	close(client.out)

	c.messageQueue <- []byte(fmt.Sprintf("%s left the chat\n", client.name))
	defer client.conn.Close()
}
```

## update handleConnection

```go
func (c *chat) handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
	in, out := make(chan []byte), make(chan []byte)
	client := newClient(conn, in, out)
	c.clients[client] = true
	client.start()
	go c.bookRoom(client)
	<-client.token // wait until the client ends writting
	c.exitQueue <- client // send client to exit queue
}

```

## test #2

last but not least the handle connection waits until the client ends writing to the connection and writes to the exit queue passing the client pointer to the channel

**client A**

```
nc localhost 8080
Enter your username: megumin
welcome megumin
trump says: hello megumin
hi trum
megumin says: hi trum
bye
megumin says: bye
^C

```

**client B**

```
nc localhost 8080
Enter your username: trump
welcome trump
hello megumin
trump says: hello megumin
megumin says: hi trum
megumin says: bye
megumin left the chat
```

# wrap-up

the overall parts of the chat are

**handleConnection** // creates new goroutines for incomming connection
**messagesManager** // sends and receives messages from clients
**server** // single serve function that waits for channel changes, newuser, disconnect, sendmessages
**bookRoom**: to format and send messages
**setUpUsername**: at the beginning of the connection we ask for a user name
**exitGuide**: closes the _in_ / _out_ channels of the client, deletes the client to the chat and closes the connection
