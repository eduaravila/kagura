## bellmanFord

> similar to dijkstra we can find the shortest path, but we'll end up if we find a negative cycle, because with this cycle we could just choose the final weight by iterating over and over through the same cycle

`
weights []*Edge
edges [] {from: *Vector, Edge}
` // this will be a connection between the source vector and the neighbors with it's weights

- initialize weights, edges
	- iterate through G.vectors and append `edges = append(edges, {from, vector, edge, current})` // in this case we are using an adjacency list with linked list
	- and weights[vector.index] = `edge{vector, weight: inf}`
- update the weight of the starting vector weights[start.index] = 0, this will let the algorithm react to weight changes
- iterate through each vertex
	- iterate through each edge // edges array
		- relax the edges and update the weights if necessary
- we'll iterate through the edges once more and if we detect a successful relax, then this means that there's a negative cycle

```go

func (G *GraphAL) BellmanFord(start, end *GraphVector) ([]*Edge, []*GraphVector) {
	weights := G.initWeightQueue() // O(V)
	edges := G.initEdgesList()     // (VE)
	path := make([]*GraphVector, G.size)
	path[start.index] = start
	weights[start.index].weight = 0

	for range G.vectors { // O (VE)
		for _, edge := range edges {
			if G.relax(&weights, edge.from, &Edge{vector: edge.to, weight: edge.weight}) {
				path[edge.to.index] = edge.from
			}

		}
	}

	for _, edge := range edges { // O(E)
		if G.checkRelax(&weights, edge.from, &Edge{vector: edge.to, weight: edge.weight}) {
			return nil, nil
		}
	}
	temp := []*GraphVector{}
	current := end
	for current != path[current.index] { // O(V)
		temp = append([]*GraphVector{current}, temp...)
		current = path[current.index]
		if current == path[current.index] {
			temp = append([]*GraphVector{current}, temp...)
		}
	}
	return weights, temp
}

```
